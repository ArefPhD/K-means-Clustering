# K-means-Clustering
K-means Clustering algorithm in Matlab
In this section, aims is to use clustering algorithms in matlab and find how self-organizing map (SOM) neural network can cluster iris flowers into classes topologically, providing insight into the types of flowers and a useful tool for further analysis.

SOM is a
(1) Competitive learning Artificial neural network (ANN)
(2) Each unit of map reduces identical inputs.
(3) Units competes for selection
(4) Modification of selected node and its neighbors. 

The matlab code to detect faces has been included in the files.
