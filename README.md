# K-means-Clustering
K-means Clustering algorithm in Matlab
In this section, aims is to use clustering algorithms in matlab and find how self-organizing map neural network can cluster iris flowers into classes topologically, providing insight into the types of flowers and a useful tool for further analysis.
